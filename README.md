founded after some days of working that world tech level arleady did that mechanics. 
Seems like World tech level not blocking some events from some mods(Milira etc.) , that why i will try continue.
Now mod work , but Conflict with World Tech level(need disable quests,incidents controlling in settings).

My current goal is to try to make blocked events that do not occur due to the narrator (user scripts, etc.) occur after reaching the required level. For example, according to the script, the event spawns on the 3-4th day, according to the settings of my mod, it blocks the quest if the colony's tech is less than the settings and then the event does not occur (according to the script, initialization occurs once), I want the event to spawn according to their settings (3-4 days, etc.) after the required tech.
